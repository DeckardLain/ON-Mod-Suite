# ON-Mod-Suite

ON Mod Suite is a user script created to enhance and fix various features of Blackbaud's web-based school management system (formally knowns as the ON Products or ON Suite).  Though originally designed for Hanalani Schools, the script can be easily forked for use on other schools' myschoolapp sites.

Blackbaud has not explicitly forbidden the use of user scripts (I asked them directly), and the script is carefully coded to ensure that it does not cause excessive server load, which would violate Blackbaud's general terms of use.  Double-check any specific terms in your Blackbaud contract before using the script.
